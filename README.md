# Toth Capstone Code
### MIDN 1/C A Toth and Asst Prof D Evangelista
This is a git repository for simulation code related to A Toth's 
honors capstone project in the Department of Weapons and Systems 
Engineering at the US Naval Academy. The project is examining 
crowds, flocks, and swarms and the effect of "informed leaders"
and the state of the crowd. Potential applications are to improve
placement and use of guides within a crowd to avoid stampedes
or catastrophes, or to most efficiently (minimal leaders / crowd)
steer or move aggregations with intent.

## Revision control with git
The code repository is revision controlled with git. 
```bash
git clone ssh://git@github.com/m196438/TothCapstone.git
git pull
make changes to changed_file.m for example
git add changed_file.m
git commit -m "I made changes to changed_file.m to implement panic mode"
git push
```

We may also find it useful to tag revisions etc. Always try to pull
changes before making new edits to avoid having to do strange merges.
